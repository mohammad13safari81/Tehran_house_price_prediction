Objective: Predict house prices in Tehran.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project includes features related to houses in Tehran, such as area, number of rooms, location, etc.
## Feature Engineering:
Handling Missing Values: Impute missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean, median, or custom imputation).
Handling Outliers: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
Normalization: Normalize numerical features to ensure consistent scaling.
## Models Evaluated:
Lasso
ElasticNet
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
